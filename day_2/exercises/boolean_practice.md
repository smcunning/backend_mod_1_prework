### Boolean Practice

1. `true && true` is true.
2. `false && true` is false.
3. `1 == 1 && 2 == 1` is false.
4. `"test" == "test"` is true.
5. `1 == 1 || 2 != 1` is true.
6. `true && 1 == 1` is true.
7. `false && 0 !=0` is false.
8. `true || 1 == 1` is true.
9. ` "test" == "testing"` is false.
10. `1 != 0 && 2 == 1 ` is false.
11. `"test" != "testing"` is true.
12. `"test" == 1` is false.
13. `!(true && false)` is true.
14. `!(1 == 1 && 0 != 1)` is false.
15. `!(10 == 1 || 1000 == 1000)` is false.
16. `!(1 != 10 || 3 == 4)` is false.
17. `!("testing" == "testing && "Zed" == "Cool Guy")` is false.
18. `1 == 1 && (!("testing" == 1 || 1 == 0))` is true.
19. `"chunky" == "bacon" && (!(3 == 4 || 3 == 3))` is false.
20. `3 == 3 && (!("testing" == "testing" || "Ruby" == "Fun"))` is false.
