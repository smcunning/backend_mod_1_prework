- A method is a "mini-script" that essentially lets you define a piece of code
that needs to be executed many times in a program.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello()
  p "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end
```


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone(Shaunda)
```
